# 📄 DocuChat AI – RAG Based Document Intelligence System

> An AI-powered document question-answering application built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Upload documents, retrieve relevant context using vector search, and receive accurate responses powered by Google's Gemini model.

---

## 🚀 Overview

DocuChat AI is a document intelligence system that allows users to interact with PDF, DOCX, and TXT files through natural language.

Instead of relying solely on a Large Language Model, the application uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to retrieve relevant document chunks before generating responses, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.

# 🧠 How It Works

### Step 1

Upload a document.

↓

### Step 2

The document is converted into plain text.

↓

### Step 3

The text is divided into overlapping chunks.

↓

### Step 4

Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings.

↓

### Step 5

Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB.

↓

### Step 6

User submits a question.

↓

### Step 7

Relevant chunks are retrieved using semantic similarity.

↓

### Step 8

Retrieved context is sent to Gemini.

↓

### Step 9

Gemini generates a context-aware answer.
